# Now that you've compiled the model, take a look a the result of your hard work! You can do this by looking at the model summary, as well as its plot.

# The summary will tell you the names of the layers, as well as how many units they have and how many parameters are in the model.

# The plot will show how the layers connect to each other.

# Import the plotting function
from keras.utils import plot_model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Summarize the model
model.summary()

# Plot the model
plot_model(model, to_file='model.png')

# Display the image
data = plt.imread('model.png')
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()
