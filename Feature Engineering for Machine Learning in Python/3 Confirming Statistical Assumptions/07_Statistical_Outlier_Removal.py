# While removing the top N% of your data is useful for ensuring that very spurious points are removed, it does have the disadvantage of always removing the same proportion of points, even if the data is correct. A commonly used alternative approach is to remove data that sits further than three standard deviations from the mean. You can implement this by first calculating the mean and standard deviation of the relevant column to find upper and lower bounds, and applying these bounds as a mask to the DataFrame. This method ensures that only data that is genuinely different from the rest is removed, and will remove fewer points if the data is close together.

# Find the mean and standard dev
std = so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'].std()
mean = so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'].mean()

# Calculate the cutoff
cut_off = std * 3
lower, upper = mean - cut_off, mean + cut_off

# Trim the outliers
trimmed_df = so_numeric_df[(so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'] < upper) \
                           & (so_numeric_df['ConvertedSalary'] > lower)]

# The trimmed box plot
trimmed_df[['ConvertedSalary']].boxplot()
plt.show()
